Description
--------------------------------
The world is awash with new data, but how can designers take the next step to make this data more meaningful in people's day-to-day lives and interactions? Put differently, instead of giving people yet more data and visualizations to interpret, how can we personalize this data to provide simple insights that more intimately connect with what an individual really cares about?

In this class, we'll examine how personalized design can give people more meaningful and pleasant experiences with their data interactions. We'll explore how new technologies and designs are implementing these personalization strategies and how they're being successful (or not). Weâ€™ll learn how to model, generate, and store our own datasets; how to build our own APIs; and ultimately how to design meaningful applications and experiences around this data.

We will do so by designing 2 core applications or experiences over the course of the class:

1. Midterm project - Designing a new (playful) interaction around a dataset that you find personally meaningful (the most important consideration for this project is that it is a dataset that **you** find personally interesting). This dataset can be from an existing source or you can create it.

2. Final project - Designing around your own data (as designing for the self is often the best starting place). Over the course of the 2nd half of the class, you will build an API around a personal dataset that you want to track and better understand, and then will design an application or experience around your personal data (personal data can include community data, like ITP).

Students will learn techniques on how to work with existing Web APIs, how to build and use their own Web APIs (with Node.js and Mongodb), and will implement user-facing designs utilizing p5.js and other Web technologies. Class examples will be presented in Javascript. Javascript tutorials will be assigned as a pre-requisite for those with little to no Javascript experience.

Objectives
---------------------

By the end of the class, you should have a solid understanding of the following concepts:

- **Full-Stack Javascript** - Familiarity with both client-side and server-side Javascript.
- **Designing Data-Driven Applications**- How to design and build a 'full-stack' data application.
- **User-facing Web design & data visualization concepts** - How to design and build user-facing interfaces & visualizations that effectively communicate data.
- **Designing Personalization Systems**- How to design systems that can collect user information and personalize data. 
- **Using APIs** - How to interact with and use an API from within your client application.
- **Structuring Data** - How to intelligently structure data.
- **Storing Data** - How to build systems to store your own data.
- **Building APIs** - How to build your own APIs and make the data available to client applications.

Listserv
--------

We will use a listserv both to conduct discussions outside of class, and for any technical help questions. **Please email the listserv with all technical help questions (often, someone else will have a very similar question, or will at least find the answer informative).**

Go [here](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/designing-for-data-personalization) and click "Subscribe to this group"


Laptops
-------

This class covers numerous Web programming topics, and as a result, we will use laptops extensively throughout class time. However, use of the computer outside of class topics (for example, chatting on Gmail or checking Facebook) is disrespectful and repeated violators will be asked to leave the classroom. 

Also - while your classmates are presenting, it is mandatory to put your laptop lid down and focus all of your attention on your colleague's presentation.

Weekly Assignments
------------------

We will have small weekly assignments that build on material presented in class. It is expected that you post all assignments to your blog, and come prepared to talk about your work (and respectfully engage with your peers when they are presenting).

Attendance
----------

Attendance is mandatory. You must inform me via email if you are going to miss a class. Habitually showing up late for class or an excessive number of absences will adversely affect your grade.

Class Participation
-------------------

Class participation is a critical part of the class, and (along with attendance) makes up 25% of your final grade. We expect pro-active participation and feedback throughout class discussions and presentations. 

Group Projects
--------------

Starting on the 3rd class, we will have weekly group projects. I will divide the class up into groups and each week one or two groups will give a 15-minute presentation. 

You can pick from 2 topics (although if you are really enthusiastic about doing something else, you may propose it):


* **Topic 1: Design Presentation/Critique** - Pick a technology (hardware, software or service), project, or theme that relates to the overall topics in the class: designing around personal data; data personalization; data tracking; physical data installations. See Week 1 "Design Topic: Examples & Inspiration for the class" for examples of the types of services you could evaluate.

    * Make a presentation that covers what the technology/service/project/theme is, what is novel about it, how are people using it and so on.
    * What do you like about it? What would you do differently?
    * Notice their design decisions (user experience, interactions, etc.). What is effective? What is not?
    * Are there are any privacy concerns? Data Limitations?
    * Does it fulfill its promise? Where could you see it going in the future?    

* **Topic 2: Quick and dirty visualization project - compile a dataset and visualize it!** - Pick a dataset that you want to compile as a group (you can manually collect it). For example, the average # of dishes left in the ITP sink at different times, noise levels on the ITP floor at different times, style trends spotted on the L train (septum piercings vs sleeve tattoos vs no socks), etc. It can be anything you find interesting and worth compiling/visualizing.
    * Compile the dataset using any process that works for you (just be prepared to present your process) -- pen/paper, Google Spreadsheet, tallies on a notepad, App connected to a database, etc.
    * Visualize the dataset in a way that helps relay its key themes and insights -- pen/paper, basic Web dashboard, 3D print, P5 sketch, performance, game, etc.
    * Present your project: why did you choose the dataset? what was interesting about it? how did you compile the data? what were your hypotheses? how did you ultimately design around the data? what were your key learnings? what were some challenges?

    * package.json / node_modules
    * .env
    * .gitignore
* Routes / Routing
* Database Schemas
    * See [Mongoose Schemas](http://mongoosejs.com/docs/guide.html)
* CRUD
    * Create
    * Retrieve (one and all)
    * Update
    * Delete
* To do POST requests, download [POSTMAN](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/postman/fhbjgbiflinjbdggehcddcbncdddomop/related?hl=en)
         
* **Assignment Week 7:**
    * Read about [RESTful APIs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer#Applied_to_web_services)
    * Get the boilerplate up and running. Email the class list if you run into any issue. Please provide the exact error you are getting and the command you ran that gave you that error.
    * Requirements
        * [Download the boilerplate zip](https://github.com/sslover/node-express-api-boilerplate) (do not clone it!)
        * Read through the entire readme! Go step by step.
        * Add some data using [POSTMAN](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/postman/fhbjgbiflinjbdggehcddcbncdddomop/related?hl=en)
            * Remember that POSTMAN is just a tool for simulating HTTP requests (HTTP requests can originate from a browser, an Arduino Yun, a mobile app, etc. POSTMAN is just a tool for testing these requests.)
            * You will be posting to the /api/create route.
            * So, you will want to choose the POST option and then enter: http://localhost:3000/api/create
            * Choose the "Body" tab and then x-www-form-urlencoded
            * Enter key, value pairs. Look at the schema to see the data that is modeled. Examples:
                * name: Billy
                * tags: cute,black,puppy 
                * age: 8
            * (the tags example is a comma-separated list that will get made into an array.. this is a standard approach)
        * Once you have some data, play around with the other routes that are in index.js (you can go to GET routes in your browser, but need to make POST routes from POSTMAN):
            * http://localhost:3000/api/get
                * (GET route)
            * http://localhost:3000/api/get/:id
                * (GET route - copy and paste the id in place of :id... you can see the id in the response of http://localhost:3000/api/get)
            * http://localhost:3000/api/delete/:id
                * (GET route - copy and paste the id in place of :id... you can see the id in the response of http://localhost:3000/api/get)
            * http://localhost:3000/api/update/:id 
                * (POST route - use POSTMAN)
            * http://localhost:3000/api/create 
                * (POST route - use POSTMAN)
        * Once you are comfortable, push the app to the heroku app you created (see the repo... it's the part with git push heroku master)
